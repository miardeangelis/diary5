I find on waking up this morning that I went to bed last night with the curtains up in my room=glad the family next door retire early—  I blushed retroactively to think of it—  Slept well—weather clear—warm. Thermometer prolongatively progressive—day so fine that barometer anaethized— breakfasted Diaried al lot of nonsense  Read some of ==Longfellows Hyperon=={Q16386175}, read to where he tells about a statue of a saint that was attacked with somnambulism and went around nights with a lantern repairing roofs, especially that of a widow woman who neglected her family to pray all the day in the church Read account of two murders in morning Herald to keep up my interest in human affairs— Built an air castle or two  Took my **new shoes** out on trial trip Read some of ==Miss Clevelands=={Q117762288} book where she goes for ==George Eliot=={Q131333} for not having an heavenly amen streak of imaginative twaddle in her poetry The girls assisted by myself trimmed the Elizabeth collars on twelve dasies, inked eyes nose & mouth on the yellow part which gave them a quaint human look, paper dresses were put on them

and all were mounted on the side of a paper box labelled "The Twelve Daughters of Venus" I hope no College bred dude will come down here and throw out insinuations that Venus was never married, and never had any children anyway Girls went in bathing. Me and **Damon** went out in the ==steam Yacht=={Q7605392} sailed around over the lobster nursury for an hour or so  In the evening Damon started a diary very witty **Miss Igoe** told Damon she couldnt express her admiration, whereupon he told her to send it by Express freight.Lunched our souls on a Strauss waltz played by ==Miss Daisy=={description="Grace 'Daisy' Gaston (1859– 1940), daughter of John M. Gaston, a prominent Indianapolis physician, was Ezra and Lillian Gilliland’s guest at their rented summer home during Edison’s earlier visit from late June to early July. She was still there, perhaps according to a plan to introduce Edison to eligible young women, when he returned on July 14."}, then we all set around the table to write up our diaries. I learned the girls how to make shadow pictures by use of crumpled  paper we tried some experiments in mind reading which were not very successful. Think mind reading contrary to common sense, wise provision of the **Bon Dieu** that we cannot read each others minds twould stop civilization and everybody would take to the woods in fifty or hundred thousand centuries when mankind have become perfect by evolution then perhaps this sense could be developed with safety to the state.

and I went into a minute expense account of our proposed earthly paradise in the land of Flowers, also a duplicate north and we concluded to take short views of life and go ahead with the scheme. It will make a savage onslaught on our bank account. Damon remarked that now all the wind work is done there only remains some little details to attend to such a "raising the money" etc.
	**Mrs Roberts** hurt her Sophrano arm and could not come over an play for us as promised and thus we lost her perfumed conversation lovely music and serephic smile La femme qui-rit Since Miss Igoe has been reading Miss Clevelands book her language has become disyllibic dissyllabic, ponderous, stiff and formal, each observation seems laundried If this weather gets much hotter, Hell will get up a reputation as a summer resort. **Dot** asked how books went in the mail. Damon said as second class matte mail matter. I said Me and Damon would go at this rating suggested that Mina would have to pay full postage. Damon thought she should be registered This reminds me that I read the other day of a man who applied for a situation as sexton in the Dead letter office. Daisies sisters

photograph rests on the mantel, shews very beautiful girl every fly that has attempted to light on it has slipped and fallen. going to put piece of chalk near it so they can chalk their feet.  this will permit with safety the insectiverous branch of nature to gaze upon a picture of what they will attained after ages of evolution. Ladies went to bed, this removed the articulating upholstery, then we went to bed.
